- Basic rendering implemented
- Need to think about editing
  - Store tokens as a tree
    - How?
  - Rendered blocks turn into textarea w/ `raw` property
  - On unfocus, run new `raw` through `lexer`
  - Surgically update tree with new node
  - Queue a file save
    - Construct raw from 1-depth tree concat
  - Track key presses (enter, bsp, arrows)
    - Enter needs to be aware of cursor line no. in block, if enter out it needs to update DOM properly
